### Installation of LTX Database (File: './sw/docu/installation_LTX_database') ###

### 16.08.2023 Jo ###

LTX can be installed WITH (named as "LTX_Server") Database and WITHOUT (named as "LTX_Legacy").

The system requirements are very low ("LTX_Server" and "LTX_Legacy"):
- Standard LAMP (or WAMP) as included with many "Web Hosting Packages" 
  (L:Linux/W:Windows A:Apache(or any other)Webserver, P:PHP(Version>=7 recommended)

For "LTX_server" additional:
- One MySQL or MariaDB (or any other SQL) Database is required
- HTTPS is required (for User Access, the data may be uploaded by HTTP, which requires less enery)

In case of "LTX_Legacy" all data will be sent to directories and ALL device's new data will
be added to a file '.../out_total/total.edt' for each device. Each device is identified by a MAC (8 Bytes)
This file is simple text ('EDT'-Format) and might become quite large over time ;-)
The input script 'sw\ltu_trigger.php' will add the data.

In case of "LTX_Server" all new data will be written to the database. There is a quota limit in
'../sw/conf/api_key.inc.php' ("DB_QUOTA" with default "3650\n100000000"). A file 'quota_days.dat' with 2-3 lines
will automatically be written for each new logger or device, 1.st line are days (here 3650), 2.nd line is lines (in the database).
The optional 3.rd line is an URL where to send a PUSH notification on new data.
The input script 'sw/ltu_trigger.php' will automatically remove older data.
Change e.g. to "90\n1000" to allow only the last 90 days or max. 1000 lines per device (so even a small DB can hold thousands of devices!).
The file 'quota_days.dat' my be set/edited to individual values per logger at any time.

***Installation:*** 

 1. Create or use a standard (empty) SQL/MySQL/MariaDB Database. Note all the credentials!

 2. Simply copy all to your server. Server normally wil run only HTTP (by default port 80).
... Activate HTTPS (SSL) for the domain, so that it runs HTTP and HTTPS.
... Devices access the Server via HTTP (HTTPS as access protocol for the devices will follow with the next release),
... The Frontend supports only HTTPS, so it is a good idea to make the Server reachable by HTTP and HTTPS with the same name.

 3. Modify './sw/conf/api_key.inc.php' as mentioned in comments:
... Most important is (rest can be changed later):
... - Set "S_DATA" to an own directory to something like "../xxx_secret_dir"
... - "L_KEY" is your Login Key for the legacy part of the software. Set to own Key 

 4. Set Access Parameters in './sw/conf/config.inc.php' as in comments:
... - First entry "192.168.."/"localhost" is for local use (e.g. with XAMPP dev kit)
... - Second entry "xyz.com" is for use on your server "xyz.com", 
...   replace all "xyz.com" with your domain, "DB_HOST" is from above (1.))

 5. Run './sw/setup.php'- This script can be run ONLY once and will install an Administrator
    This Script will ONLY run, if the database is COMPLETELY empty! 
	(optionally clear existing database w.g. with PHPAdmin)
... _Remark: By default: the Database's Username and Password will be used for ADMIN_ 

 6. Set your Server name and path in the 'sys_param.lxp' file on the device. 

 7. Make a test transmition
 
 8. Peridocally (e.g. each day) call './sw/service/service.php' to clean/check up Database!
    A Mail will be sent to the (Admin) with a short summary.
	(Note: optionally $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'], $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], etc.  must be set in 'service.php' for CRON, see comments at beginning of 'service.php').
	(Hint: often the CRON command is a system call like "/bin/php ./JoEmbedded_Run/ltx/sw/service/service.php")
    (Hint: Manual call / tests for 'service.php' via './sw/service/index.php')
	(Hint: As URL: e.g. "http(s)://myltx.com/ltx/sw/service/service.php")
